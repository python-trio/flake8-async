# ASYNCIO_NO_ERROR
# ARG --enable=ASYNC100,ASYNC912
# asyncio is tested in async912_asyncio. Cancelscopes in anyio are named the same
# as in trio, so they're also tested with this file.

# ASYNC100 has autofixes, but ASYNC912 does not. This leaves us with the option
# of not testing both in the same file, or running with NOAUTOFIX.
